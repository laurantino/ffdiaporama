This is a fork of ffdiaporama, to make it work with recent ffmpeg or qt versions.

The goal of this fork is just to make ffdiaporama compile and work with recent gcc, ffmpeg and qt versions under Linux.

There is no plan to improve the software.

Information about the software can be found here http://ffdiaporama.tuxfamily.org
